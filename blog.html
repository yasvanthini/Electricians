              <h3>
                How to Prevent Electrical Circuit Overloads
              </h3>
              <p>
                Unless you have a hardware issue that needs to be addressed, preventing circuit overloads takes very little effort. Here are 
                some tips that will help you avoid circuit overloads in your home:Distribute your devices: In our example of how to cause a 
                circuit overload, you probably noticed that it involved putting a lot of devices on a single circuit and running them at once. 
            
                <h5>What is a Circuit Overload and What Causes Them?</h5>  
                A circuit overload is what happens when too much current flow is running through your wiring. Typically, it is caused by an excessive demand for electricity 
                along a single circuit. For example, if you’re working in the kitchen and use multiple appliances with heating elements at once, such as a microwave, 
                electric kettle, and a toaster oven, you stand a strong chance of overloading your circuit.
                <br><br><h5>Hardware Upgrade Solutions for Overloaded Electrical Circuits</h5>         
                The wiring in some houses isn’t up to snuff for what modern devices require. If this is the case with your home, then it’s time to call a professional. Here are some 
                solutions that an electrician can carry out to make your house safer and more overload-proof:<br>
                <br><b>Use dedicated circuits:</b> Dedicated circuits are used to support high power consumption devices. Generally, you’d use dedicated circuits 
                for large appliances like air conditioners, electric ranges, washers, dryers, hot tubs, dishwashers, and other similar 
                 appliances.

                 <br><b>Upgrade your circuit breaker:</b> Your circuit breakers, which are found in your electrical panel, are more than just the place you go to turn overloaded circuits back on. 
                 The panel itself supplies power to all your circuits, and new models can provide better power and do it more safely.

              <h3>
                Dangers of an Overloaded Circuit
              </h3>
              <p>
                <br>Overloading an electrical circuit can cause some serious problems. While that may seem obvious, chances are that you’ve caused a circuit overload at least once in your life.
                The good news is that most modern homes are equipped to handle circuit overloads. In most cases, it will trip your circuit breaker and all you’ll have to do is flip it back on.
                However, not all circuit overloads go as planned. Regardless of whether you have a modern circuit breaker in your home, you should always do your best to avoid a circuit overload.
                Still not sure what the big deal is? Read on to learn more about the dangers of an overloaded circuit and find out how you can prevent them.  
                <br><h5>What is an Overloaded Circuit?</h5>
                An overloaded circuit is what happens when too much electrical demand is placed on a single circuit. For example, if you’re cooking and decide to use a toaster oven and an air fryer on the same outlet, you’ll probably overload your circuit.
                <br>It’s pretty easy to avoid circuit overloads like that, but they can strike even when you think you’re being safe. What’s most important is that you understand which outlets are on the same circuit and then distribute your high-consumption devices across those circuits. <br>           
               <br><h5>How to Check for a Circuit Overload?</h5> 
                When you overload a circuit, it will likely be obvious. In most cases, it will shut off the power to a room in your home.
                To confirm that it was a circuit overload and not a power outage, check to see if the power is off in other rooms. You can also go to your electrical panel and see if the switch to the affected room is flipped to the off position. 
                If it is, then you’ve overloaded the circuit and tripped the breaker.
                <br>
                In some cases, circuit overloads aren’t your fault. Sure, if you’re plugging five kitchen appliances into a single power strip, you’re definitely to blame, 
                but that’s likely not the case.
